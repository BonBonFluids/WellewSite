            <h3>Our Story</h3>
            <p>Our team of nutritionists, dietitians, software engineers, and wellness enthusiasts came together with a shared vision: to create an intelligent, user-friendly platform that goes beyond simple calorie counting. We wanted to build a companion that guides you, educates you, and supports you every step of the way on your unique health journey.</p>

            <h3>Our Philosophy</h3>

Our goal is to provide you with the tools and knowledge to make informed decisions about your health that last a lifetime.</p>
